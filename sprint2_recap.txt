Note:
We spent more time on making the UI look better and setting up the backend rather than what we thought we would do.
Instead on focusing on some of the functionalities that are similar to that of grumblr, we decided to implement more backbone
for the game itself. We managed to make a multiplayer table for the users to join and by what was completed in the backend, 
we should've been able to join those tables with other players. Because we needed the information that came from the players
actually joining the tables and playing the game, a lot of our print's goals could not be completed. We will complete them
in the third and final sprint, when we add in ajax and javascript.
